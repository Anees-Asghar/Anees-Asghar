I'm a computer engineering student and a programming enthusiast who is passionate about learning and growing in the fields of web development and data science. Some technologies/tools I enjoy working with are python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and django. 

You can check out some of my machine learning and web development projects as well as some interesting python scripts right here on github. You can also take a look at some of my exploratory data analysis projects on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aneesasghar).
